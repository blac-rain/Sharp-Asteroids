# Sharp Asteroids
a small asteroids like game

# Todo List
## Coming
- Enemies also from up and down

## QoL
- different shape for Enemy, more like asteroids (use image?)
- change or improve the representation of the player (perhaps a new form?)
- Display of points and death counters and game time not only as DrawText, e.g. as a separate bar at the bottom or top
- change font
- add game sounds
	- fire bullet
	- player movement
	- enemy spawn

## Maybe
- Resizable window
- window and other information as variables not literals
- Start Button (new overlay or menu class for such functions?)
- Pause function
- enemy does not spawn in the player or directly to the player
- win or lose stops player movement (not a bug but a feature to move after game ends?)
