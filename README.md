# Sharp Asteroids
a small asteroids like game

# Todo List
## Coming
- Incorporate losing and winning
	- needs its own overlay and has to stop the game (possibly new class "GameOverScreen"?), 
	- important but I can't estimate how complex that is

## QoL
- different shape for Enemy, more like asteroids -> use image?
- change or improve the representation of the player -> perhaps a new form?

## Maybe
- Display of points and death counters not only as DrawText, e.g. as a separate bar at the bottom or top
- Display game time
- Resizable window
- Enemies from all sides, just edges
- window and other information as variables
- Start Button -> new overlay or menu class for such functions?
- Pause function
- enemy does not spawn in the player or directly to the player
